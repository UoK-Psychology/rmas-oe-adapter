    The runner module is automatically generated by the RMAS Adapter framework.
    You can run this module directly `python runner.py` which will call the run
    function for you or you can call the run function directly from elsewhere.

        This function starts the lifecycle consumer which will start
        listening for OpenEthics lifecycle events, and then it will start
        polling the RMAS ESB for RMAS events (polling is blocking so you must 
        start the liefecycle consumer first).
